# AI-Driven Supply Chain Optimization Using Reinforcement Learning 🚀
Optimizing Inventory Management & Order Fulfillment with AI

📌 Project Overview
This project implements Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize supply chain operations. The AI agent learns to make data-driven inventory and order decisions to minimize costs, prevent stock shortages, and maximize efficiency.

💡 Key Features:
✅ Uses Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for decision-making
✅ Simulates a dynamic supply chain environment with variable demand & supplier delays
✅ Optimizes inventory management, ordering policies, and supply chain resilience

📊 Motivation & Problem Statement
Supply chains suffer from inefficiencies like:
 Overstocking leading to wasted resources
 Understocking causing lost sales
 Delays due to poor demand forecasting

👉 Solution: Train an AI agent to learn the best inventory management policy using reinforcement learning (DQN).

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Frameworks: OpenAI Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3, TensorFlow
RL Algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN)
Other Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV (for visualization)
⚙ How It Works
1️⃣ The environment simulates a supply chain where an AI agent controls inventory.
2️⃣ The agent learns from rewards and penalties (e.g., high storage cost = penalty).
3️⃣ Over time, the agent optimizes supply chain decisions to maximize profits.

📌 Results & Improvements
✅ Reduced average supply chain cost by X%
✅ Minimized stockouts & overstocking
✅ Faster order processing with AI-driven decision making

📈 Future Improvements:
🔹 Implement multi-agent RL for supplier-distributor collaboration
🔹 Use LSTM models for demand forecasting
